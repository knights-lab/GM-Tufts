These results contain:

1) per-lab delta-covariate-vs-delta-taxon results WITHOUT controlling for baseline

2) L2, L6 Taxon Levels and Metagenome comparisons for:
a) delta_taxa ~ group + taxa_time1 (delta_taxa between Group A vs Group B while controlling for Time 1)	
b) taxa_time2 ~ group + taxa_time1 (RG vs. WG at W6 = Group A vs Group B at Time 2 while controlling for Time 1)
