Taxon Differences
There is no differential taxon although Ruminococcus is ALMOST statistically significant between the two fiber groups at the end of treatment (showing a reduction in Group B).
	Timepoint 1 vs. Timepoint 2, stratify by Group A,B
	Group A
		1. arcsin sqrt transformed + LM while controlling for confounders: NO significant GENUS Level taxa distinguishable between time 1 vs 2
		2. arcsin sqrt transformed + LM while controlling for confounders: NO significant PHYLUM Level taxa distinguishable between time 1 vs 2
	Group B
		1. arcsin sqrt transformed + LM while controlling for confounders: NO significant GENUS Level taxa distinguishable between time 1 vs 2
		2. arcsin sqrt transformed + LM while controlling for confounders: NO significant PHYLUM Level taxa distinguishable between time 1 vs 2

	Group A vs. Group B (Timepoint 2 only)
	L6
		k__Bacteria;p__Firmicutes;c__Clostridia;o__Clostridiales;f__Ruminococcaceae;g__Ruminococcus --> p-value = 0.0627, Group B estimate = -0.0756
	L2 
		None

	Group A vs. Group B (Timepoint 1 only)
	L6
		None
	L2 
		None

Alpha Diversity
- there appear to be differences in alpha diversity based on the starting points of the two groups, although these converge at the end of the treatment

	WITHOUT RESAMPLING
	-> alpha$PD_whole_tree is NOT normally distributed based on Shapiro Wilks (P-value = 8.8e10-6)	
	Using Mann Whitney U test
		Group A vs. Group B; Timepoint 1
			 p-value = 0.01451
		Group A vs. Group B; Timepoint 2
			 p-value = 0.0642

	(Within-Group comparisons are not significant)
	
	WITH RESAMPLING
	-> alpha$PD_whole_tree IS normally distributed based on Shapiro Wilks (P-value = 0.1818)
	Using t-test (at depth = 19490)
		Group A vs. Group B; Timepoint 1
			 p-value = 0.01266
		Group A vs. Group B; Timepoint 2
			 p-value = 0.106

Adonis Output
- It appears that using unweighted unifrac, there is a significant difference between Group A and Group B at time point 1, and almost at timepoint 2
	Time 1 Unweighted Unifrac P-value = 0.05
	Time 2 Unweighted Unifrac P-value = 0.07
	Time 1 Weighted Unifrac P-value = 0.39
	Time 2 Weighted Unifrac P-value = 0.25

Predictive Modeling of Clinical Covariates
- See how well MB can predict changes in glucose tolerance, blood pressure, or BMI before and after Fiber Intervention

PROBLEMS: Could not find ACETATE_1, BUTYRATE_1, ADJREE in mapping file

TODO
* for all results: UNCORRECTED P-VALUES, COEFFICIENTS
XXX 1.) Redo taxon associations using Delta Taxa Abundances with Time 2 values for everything else
2.) Redo Adonis while controlling for confounders
XXX3.) Taxon and Clinical Vars (Association Test)
* Add new column AR as sum of ARA_1	ARA_2	ARB_1	ARB_2	ARC_1	ARC_2
* See if we can still do OGTT_AUCG
XXX	- Delta clinical var ~ (Delta Taxon) * Group
		- Look at interaction term, and Delta taxon term
XXX	- Delta clinical var ~ (Delta Taxon) [stratified by Group]
		- Look at Delta taxon term
4.) Redo everything with PICRUST
5.)
XXX--> time 1 alpha div ~ delta clinical covariate
XXX--> delta alpha div ~ delta clinical covariate
XXX--> time 1 microbiome ~ time 1 clinical covariate (association test, then RF)
